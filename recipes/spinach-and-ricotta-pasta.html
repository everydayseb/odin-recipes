    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>150g/5½oz dried farfalle or tagliatelle</li>
        <li>200g/7oz fresh spinach or defrosted frozen spinach</li>
        <li>50g/1¾oz unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>125g/4½oz ricotta</li>
        <li>freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 tbsp grated pecorino (or alternative vegetarian hard cheese)</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions, or until al 
            dente. Drain and reserve a cupful of the cooking water. </li>

        <li>If using fresh spinach, cook it with a splash of water in a 
            saucepan for 1–2 minutes, or until wilted, then leave to cool. 
            Squeeze all the liquid out of the spinach using your hands and 
            roughly chop. </li>
    
        <li>Melt the butter in a large frying pan. Once foaming, add the 
            spinach, garlic, cooked pasta and a splash of the pasta cooking 
            water and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring frequently. Add more of 
            the cooking water if needed. Add the ricotta and cook gently while 
            mixing with two forks to break it up. </li>
    
        <li>Season with the nutmeg, percorino, salt and pepper and serve.</li>
